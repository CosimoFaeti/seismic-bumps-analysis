# Seismic Bumps Analysis  
This repository contains my project for the *Data Mining I course* of my Master's degree in Data Science and Business Informatics at Universit√† di Pisa.
The aim of the project is to predict in which conditions it is more likely that seismic activity could cause a rockburst using machine learning methods.
Specifically, mining activity is connected with the occurrence of dangers, a special case of such a threat is the seismic
hazard which frequently occurs in many underground mines. Seismic hazard is the hardest detectable and predictable
of natural hazards and in this respect it is comparable to an earthquake. *Seismic Bumps* data set tries to describe the problem of high energy seismic bumps forecasting
in a coal mine; its data come from detections carried out by two longwalls in a Polish coal mine.

## Repository Overview
In this repository, in the root level, you can find the pdf version of the report, the data and the code for the implementation of machine learning models for Seismic Bumps data set. More specifically:

**Data Understanding and Preparation**:
* Data Understanding & Preparation.ipynb : contains data understanding, preparation and cleaning, as well as exploratory data analysis

**Clustering**:
* Python files contain the implementation of clustering models (K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering)

**Classification**:
* Python files contain the implementation of classification models (Decision Tree, K-NN, Random Forest)

**Pattern Mining**:
* Python files contain the implementation of pattern mining techniques
